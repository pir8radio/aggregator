# Aggregator - Signum Miner Proxy

The Signum Aggregator allows you to have many small miners on your local network and save bandwidth and resources by making them appear as one big miner to the mining pool!    Another handy use is to send one or many miners to multiple pools or totally different PoS+ blockchains or even a TESTNET pool while you mine on the main net!

### Requirements
- go >= 1.11

### Compile

``` shell
go build
```

## Configure

All settings to be made in config.yaml

### Run

``` shell
./aggregator
```
